If only I could get David and Nisse on the train, this could end in the most beautiful manner. At least if your idea of 
beauty is shooting cows with a bazooka. _Just sayin_

*First time*
Create subfolders js/lib/physicsjs, and download the dependencies.

*Dependencies*
jQuery - Just DL the latest version (minified) and put it in js/lib under the name of "jquery.js" 
    http://jquery.com/download/  
jCanvas - Same thing as jQuery  
    http://plugins.jquery.com/jcanvas/  
PhysicsJS - Download the distribution of PhysicsJS, unpack it, and copy the "dist" subfolder to js/lib/physicsjs  
    ...alternately, you could just create the physicsjs subfolder and copy physicsjs-full.js there (for now).

*Or just try it*
